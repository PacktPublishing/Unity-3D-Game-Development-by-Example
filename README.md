## About the Video Course
The fast, easy way to start developing Unity games

There’s no better way to begin building impressive video games than Unity. The free software gives you the tools you need to create stunning 3D games and publish them for computers, phones, tablets, and the web.

The indie game revolution has begun and all over the world, unique and incredible games are being made in professional and home studios. Learn the skills you need to take part in this revolution, lending your creative spark to the scene using Unity3D! 

Unity3D by example will arm you with the basic skills needed to take your beginner level programming skills and transform yourself into a full-fledged game developer capable of making games on the web, PC, Mac, iPhone or Android, using Unity3D and the C# language.

With Unity3D by Example, you will go from beginning as a C# programmer to a published, multi-platform game developer with a course of a few hours. 

Along the way, you’ll learn a lot about the multi-platform game engine Unity3D, starting with simply understanding how it works and building on that knowledge with each segment until you know everything there is to know about basic game building. It doesn’t stop there. Along the way you’ll also learn a little bit about game AI, game publishing and even learn how to become a part of the Unity 3D Community itself.

Where you go from there is up to you, but with Unity3D by Example, you will be armed with the knowledge of the pros and the skills you need to be your own game publisher!
